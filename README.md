Introduction:

This repository contains a series of SQL assignments representing different aspects of database management and application development. The assignments are structured to cover various tasks related to designing, populating, and interacting with a database system. Each assignment focuses on a specific aspect of database management, including schema design, data insertion, function definition, and stored procedure implementation.

The assignments are organized as follows:

Assignment 1: Create Tables: This assignment involves designing the database schema by creating tables to store information about customers, instructors, and appointments.

Assignment 2: Insert Data: In this assignment, sample data is inserted into the tables created in Assignment 1 to simulate real-world scenarios.

Assignment 3: Define Age Calculation Function: Here, a custom function named CALC_AGE is defined to calculate the age range of customers based on their date of birth and the date and time of an appointment.

Assignment 4: Define Appointment Listing Procedure: This assignment focuses on defining a stored procedure named LIST_APPOINTMENTS, which retrieves information about appointments based on the instructor's ID and the month provided.
Each assignment contributes to building a comprehensive database system for managing customer appointments with instructors. Together, they demonstrate proficiency in database schema design, data manipulation, and procedural SQL programming.
